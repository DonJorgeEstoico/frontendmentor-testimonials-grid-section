                            I received a job mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company
                            I joined. I honestly feel i got every penny's worth.

                            and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro mid-course
                            and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - 
                            time of my life. Since completting the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software
                            Engineer at a VR startup. "

                        who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs
                        who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
                        were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
                        outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could never have. In fact. I've
                        often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me 
                        land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple oofers. 100% recommend! "
